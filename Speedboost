--// CUSTOM KICK MESSAGE FOR LEAKERS
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local LocalPlayer = Players.LocalPlayer

-- Your custom message
local KICK_MESSAGE = "⚠️ Someone leaked this script! Please contact the owner."

-- Function to kick the player with the message
local function kickPlayer()
    -- Protect it with pcall so nothing breaks
    pcall(function()
        LocalPlayer:Kick(KICK_MESSAGE)
    end)
end

-- Example: check for "leak condition"
-- Here you can check for anything you consider a leak
-- For demo, let's just kick if the player's name is not yours
-- Replace "YourUsernameHere" with your Roblox username
if LocalPlayer.Name ~= "YourUs
